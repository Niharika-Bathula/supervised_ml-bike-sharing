Problem Statement:

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.
Project Summary -
Bike sharing demand prediction is a supervised machine learning project that aims to forecast the number of bikes that will be rented in a given time period, typically on an hourly or daily basis. This project is of great significance for bike sharing companies and urban planners as it helps optimize bike availability, manage resources efficiently, and improve the overall user experience. In this type of project, historical data on bike rentals, along with various features such as weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week, are used to train a predictive model. This model can then be used to make future predictions and guide decision-making.

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

The first step in building a bike sharing demand prediction model is to collect and preprocess the relevant data. Historical data from the bike sharing system is typically gathered, which includes information such as the date and time of rentals, the number of rented bikes, and additional features like weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, and wind speed), time-related information (e.g., day of the week, hour of the day), and potentially holiday information.

Data preprocessing is crucial to ensure the data is in a suitable format for training a machine learning model. This involves tasks such as handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, normalizing or scaling features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively.

Feature Engineering:

Feature engineering plays a crucial role in improving the predictive power of the model. It involves selecting the most relevant features, creating new features, and transforming existing features to make them more informative. For example, one might create a new feature representing the hour of the day as a categorical variable (morning, afternoon, evening, night) to capture daily patterns.

Model Selection:

In a supervised machine learning project like this, selecting an appropriate model is essential. Common choices for bike sharing demand prediction include regression models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. These models can capture both linear and nonlinear relationships between the input features and the target variable, which is typically the number of bike rentals.

Model Training and Evaluation:

The selected model is trained on the historical data, using a portion of the dataset for training and the rest for testing. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to assess the model's accuracy and determine how well it generalizes to unseen data. Cross-validation techniques may also be employed to ensure the model's robustness.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters is essential to optimize its performance. Hyperparameters control the behavior of the model and can significantly impact its predictive power. Techniques like grid search or random search can be used to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

Deployment and Monitoring:

Once a satisfactory model is developed, it can be deployed in a production environment. Continuous monitoring is essential to ensure that the model's predictions remain accurate over time, as the real-world data distribution may change.

Conclusion
In this project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of bike-sharing demand prediction, utilizing supervised machine learning techniques, and explored the crucial factors affecting bike rentals. Our objective was to provide actionable insights to optimize business operations, pricing strategies, and user experience. Through the examination of various features and the development of a predictive model, we have gained valuable insights into the dynamics of bike sharing.

Model Performance and Insights

We assessed the performance of our predictive model, employing Random Forest Regression. Our evaluation yielded encouraging results with relatively low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), indicating the model's capability to make reasonably accurate predictions. Furthermore, the R-squared (R^2) value suggested that a substantial portion of the variance in bike rentals can be explained by the selected features. This implies that the model successfully captures the underlying trends and patterns in the data.

Feature Importance and Seasonal Trends

Our analysis uncovered the significance of several features in predicting bike rentals. Temperature, humidity, and wind speed emerged as influential factors. Higher temperatures and lower humidity levels were associated with increased bike rentals, suggesting a preference for favorable weather conditions among users. Conversely, strong winds had an adverse effect on bike rentals.

Additionally, we identified distinct seasonal trends in bike rentals. Demand was highest during the summer months, with a notable increase in June, July, and August. This could be attributed to the pleasant weather and increased outdoor activities during the summer. On the other hand, bike rentals declined during the winter months, with December exhibiting the lowest demand. These insights are crucial for resource allocation and marketing strategies, enabling the business to efficiently meet demand during peak seasons and potentially introduce promotions during the off-season.

Business Implications and Recommendations

The insights derived from our analysis hold significant implications for the bike-sharing business. By understanding the impact of weather conditions and seasonality, the business can optimize operations and enhance user experience. During periods of high demand, such as summer, the service can ensure an adequate supply of bikes and allocate resources efficiently. Moreover, data-driven marketing and promotional strategies tailored to specific weather conditions can attract more customers.

To further improve the user experience, the business can implement safety measures, particularly during adverse weather. For example, enhanced lighting and reflectors on bikes can promote safety during low-visibility conditions. Such measures can bolster user confidence and increase ridership.

We recommend that the bike-sharing service invest in targeted marketing and promotions, especially during low-demand periods. By offering discounts or special incentives during winter or on days with poor weather, the business can stimulate demand and attract users who may otherwise be deterred by weather-related concerns.

In conclusion, our project has provided valuable insights into bike-sharing demand prediction. By understanding the relationship between weather conditions, seasonality, and bike rentals, the business can make informed decisions to enhance performance, user satisfaction, and overall growth. With these insights in mind, the bike-sharing service is well-positioned to optimize operations, implement effective marketing strategies, and foster a positive impact on business performance.
